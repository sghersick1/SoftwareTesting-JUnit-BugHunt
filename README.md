# SoftwareTesting-JUnit-BugHunt
### Group 07: Sam Hersick and Mushtariy Ishmukhamedova  

## 📘 Overview  
This project was developed for **CS483 (Object-Oriented Programming & Design)** Assignment 3A–3B: *“Bug Hunt via JUnit.”*  
The goal is to design a small-but-nontrivial Java program with multiple classes and realistic seeded bugs, then later identify and fix them using JUnit tests.

## 🧩 Project Description  
Our program simulates a **[INSERT YOUR CHOSEN PROJECT NAME HERE — e.g., “Mini Wordle Game” or “Bank Account Manager”]**, written in **Java 17**.  
It includes several interacting classes, clear logic, and intentional subtle bugs across different categories (boundary, state, nullability, floating-point, etc.).  

The project includes:
- 6–12 public methods across 1–3 classes  
- Javadoc documentation for all classes and methods  
- A `main()` method to demonstrate example usage  
- A **README** and **Bug Description** file for clarity and reproducibility
